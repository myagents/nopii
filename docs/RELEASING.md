# Releasing nopii

This document describes how we cut and publish releases of the `nopii` package
to TestPyPI and PyPI using GitHub Actions with PyPI Trusted Publishers (OIDC).
It’s written for maintainers and is safe to share publicly.

## Overview

- Source repository: https://github.com/ay-mich/nopii
- Distribution name (PyPI): `nopii`
- Import package: `nopii`
- CLI commands: `nopii` (preferred) and `no-pii` (alias)
- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- Build tool: `uv build` (produces wheel + sdist in `dist/`)
- Publisher: PyPI/TestPyPI Trusted Publisher via GitHub OIDC (no API tokens)

## Versioning

- We follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), with optional pre-release tags (e.g., `-rc.1`).
- The version appears in two places and must be kept in sync:
  - `pyproject.toml` `[project].version`
  - `src/nopii/__init__.py` `__version__`

## One-time setup (per index)

Set up a Trusted Publisher for both TestPyPI and PyPI.

1. Create the project on TestPyPI and PyPI if not already present.
2. In TestPyPI: Project → Settings → Publishing → Add a Publisher → GitHub
   - Owner: your GitHub username/org
   - Repository: `ay-mich/nopii`
   - Workflow: `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (or “Any workflow”)
   - Environment: leave default (unless you use environments; see below)
   - Save
3. Repeat the same in PyPI.
4. In GitHub repo settings (optional but recommended):
   - Environments → create `pypi-release` and add “Required reviewers” to gate real PyPI publishes.

## CI behavior (publish.yml)

- Trigger: pushing a tag matching `v*` runs the workflow.
- Jobs:
  - `build`: checks out code, runs `uv build`, uploads `dist/*` as an artifact.
  - `publish-testpypi`: downloads artifact and publishes to TestPyPI using OIDC.
    - Uses `skip-existing: true` so re-running with the same version does not fail.
  - `publish-pypi`: downloads artifact and publishes to PyPI using OIDC.
    - Runs only for tags starting with `v` that do not contain `rc`.
    - Protected by the `pypi-release` environment (manual approval if configured).
- Concurrency: tags share a concurrency group, so we won’t double-publish the same ref.
- Attestations: enabled (PEP 740) for supply-chain provenance.

## Pre-release checklist

- [ ] Ensure the main branch is green: tests, mypy, ruff.
- [ ] Update docs as needed and ensure README is consistent with features.
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md`: finalize the version section and today’s date.
- [ ] Bump version in both files:
  - `pyproject.toml`
  - `src/nopii/__init__.py`
- [ ] (Optional) Local sanity build and metadata validation:
  ```bash
  uv build
  python -m twine check dist/*
  ```

## Cutting a release candidate (RC)

Use RCs to test the pipeline without publishing to PyPI.

```bash
git switch main
git pull

# Bump version to e.g. 0.1.1-rc.1 in pyproject.toml and src/nopii/__init__.py
git commit -am "release: v0.1.1-rc.1"
git tag v0.1.1-rc.1
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

What happens:

- CI builds and publishes the artifact to TestPyPI.
- The PyPI job is skipped due to the `rc` condition.

Verify on TestPyPI:

```bash
uv pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple nopii==0.1.1rc1
python -c "import nopii; print(nopii.__version__)"
nopii --version
```

Note: pre-release normalization may omit the dash in the install spec (e.g., `0.1.1rc1`).

## Cutting a stable release

```bash
git switch main
git pull

# Bump version to e.g. 0.1.1 in pyproject.toml and src/nopii/__init__.py
git commit -am "release: v0.1.1"
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

What happens:

- CI builds and publishes to TestPyPI.
- CI publishes to PyPI after `pypi-release` environment approval (if configured).

Post-release verification:

```bash
pip install -U nopii==0.1.1
python -c "import nopii; print(nopii.__version__)"
nopii --version
```

## Local/manual publishing (rare)

Normally we publish via CI. For emergencies or testing only:

```bash
uv build
python -m twine check dist/*

# TestPyPI
uv publish --repository testpypi

# PyPI (ensure you understand the implications)
uv publish
```

## Troubleshooting

- CI fails with “403: Forbidden” during publish:
  - Ensure Trusted Publisher is configured on the target index (TestPyPI/PyPI) for this repo.
  - The workflow file path and environment must match what PyPI/TestPyPI trusts.
- CI fails with “File already exists”:
  - Version already published. Bump the version before tagging.
- CI waits for approval / “Required reviewers”:
  - Approve the `pypi-release` environment in the Actions UI.
- Can't install from TestPyPI:
  - Use the TestPyPI index: `uv pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple nopii==X.Y.Z`
  - Or `pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple nopii==X.Y.Z`
- CLI/import mismatch:
  - Distribution is `nopii`, import is `nopii`, CLI is `nopii` or `no-pii`.
- Metadata check fails:
  - Run `python -m twine check dist/*` locally and correct errors (e.g., invalid URLs).

## Notes on provenance and security

- We avoid long‑lived API tokens by using PyPI Trusted Publishers (OIDC).
- The workflow enables build attestations (PEP 740). PyPI may surface a “Verified” badge for provenance.

## Yank or rollback

- PyPI supports yanking a release (soft removal) via the web UI.
- To fix a broken release, cut a new patch version and publish (preferred over deleting files).

## Summary (quick start)

1. Update CHANGELOG and bump version in `pyproject.toml` and `src/nopii/__init__.py`.
2. Commit: `release: vX.Y.Z`.
3. Tag and push: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin main --follow-tags`.
4. Approve the `pypi-release` environment when prompted (stable only).
5. Verify install, import, and CLI version from PyPI.
